# SwiftPlaygroundExample

Apple has all kinds of Swift playgrounds to explain programming topics but I was missing a nice and compact example to explain the capabilities of playgrounds themselves.

Just open the <b>ExamplePlayground.playground</b> file in <b>XCode 7.3</b> or newer.

The rest should be self\-explanatory.

PS: If you have a nice addition, don't forget to create a pull request :)
